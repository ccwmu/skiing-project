# Ski Detection via Computer Vision
This project detects skis in still images using OpenCV and image processing techniques. It’s a step toward a more advanced app that will analyze skiers’ technique based on their skis and lower body using computer vision and AI.

## Features
- Detects skis using HSV color thresholding
- Cleans detection mask with morphological operations (closing and dilation)
- Filters contours by size and shape to identify ski-like objects
- Draws bounding boxes and prints size info for detected skis

## Setup

### Requirements

 - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python") 3.7+
 - `numpy`
 - `openCV-python`

### Installation

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python")
- Clone the repo or download as ZIP and extract it to a new folder
- Install the required modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `detect-skis.py`
